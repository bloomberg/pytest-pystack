# Contributing

Before contributing to this repository, first please discuss the change you wish to make via an
issue, or any other method of communication with the maintainers of this repository.


## Contribution Licensing

Since this project is distributed under the terms of an [open source license](LICENSE),
contributions that you make are licensed under the same terms. For us to be able to accept your
contributions, we will need explicit confirmation from you that you are able and willing to provide
them under these terms, and the mechanism we use to do this is called a Developer's Certificate of
Origin [(DCO)](https://github.com/bloomberg/.github/blob/main/DCO.md). This is similar to the
process used by the Linux kernel, Samba, and many other major open source projects.

To participate under these terms, all that you must do is include a line like the following as the
last line of the commit message for each commit in your contribution:

    Signed-Off-By: Random J. Developer <random@developer.example.org>

The simplest way to accomplish this is to add `-s` or `--signoff` to your `git commit` command.

You must use your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms, and no anonymous contributions).

## Tests

Changes should always include tests. If this is a bug fix it is a good idea to add the tests as the
first commit of the pull request and the changes to fix the issue in subsequent commits to make it
easier to validate it.
